# Virtual Storefront

This application is an online storefront that allows users to browse product offerings by category, place items in their shopping cart, and check-out when they are ready to make their purchase.

## Requirements

### Phase 1 Application Setup

* Setup basic React application
* Implement Redux to create a state management system
* At this phase state for users, store items, etc should be managed in memory instead of the persistance layer of an API.
